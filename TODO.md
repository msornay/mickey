# TODO

- When applying a patch leaves a folder empty in merge-queue, delete the
  repository
- am should also sanity check patches for personal or confidential or secret
  information. any leak shoould print a big warnign and the patch shouldn't be
  applied.
- Implicit TODO in all repo: well-organized, KISS, just the right amount of
  documentation. Simple E2E sanity tests commited and green
- If possible, some inside on stdout about what agents are doing
- Also look for TODO.md at the root of the workspace ($WORKSPACE_DIR/TODO.md),
  not just inside individual repos
